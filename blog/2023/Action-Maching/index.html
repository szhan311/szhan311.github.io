Let each particle follow a timedependent ODE (continuous flow) with the velocity field $v:[0,1] \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ as follows <ul> <li>$\frac{d}{d t} x(t)=v_t(x(t)), \quad x(t=0)=x$</li> <li>The continuity equation describes how the density of the particles $q_t$ evolves in time $t$, i.e.,</li> <li>$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} q_t=-\nabla \cdot\left(q_t v_t\right)$ <h2 id="density-space-to-state-space">Density space to state space</h2> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong>. Consider a continuous dynamic with the density evolution of $q_t$, which satisfies mild conditions (absolute continuty in the 2-Wassertein space of distributions $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{X})$. Then there exists a unique (up to a constant) function $s_t^<em>(x)$, called the “action”, such that vector field $v_t^</em>(x) = \nabla s_t^<em>(x)$ and $q_t$ satisfies the continuity equation $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} q_t=-\nabla \cdot\left(q_t \nabla s_t^</em>(x)\right)$.</li> <li>In other words, the ODE $\frac{d}{d t} x(t)=\nabla s_t^*(x)$ can be used to move samples in time such that the marginals are $q_t$.</li> <li>Using Theorem 2.1, the problem of learning the dynamics can be boiled down to learning the unique vector field $\nabla s_t^*$</li> <li>Based on Theorem 2.1, given density dynamic, we can learn a function $s_t(x, \theta)$ to approximate $s_t^*$. Then Given $s_t(x, \theta)$, we can calculate the dynamic in the state space.</li> </ul> <h1 id="action-matching">Action matching</h1> <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2> <p>Recover the true action $s_t^<em>$ while having access only to samples from $q_t$. The objective is to minimize the “ACTION-GAP” objective $\operatorname{ACTION-GAP}\left(s, s^</em>\right):=\frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \mathbb{E}_{q_t(x)}\left|\nabla s_t(x)-\nabla s_t^*(x)\right|^2 d t$</p> <h2 id="tractable-objective">Tractable objective</h2> <p>Theorem 2.2. For an arbitrary variational action $s$, the ACTION-GAP $\left(s, s^<em>\right)$ can be decomposed as the sum of an intractable constant $\mathcal{K}$, and a tractable term $\mathcal{L}_{A M}(s)$ $\operatorname{ACTION-GAP}\left(s_t, s_t^</em>\right)=\mathcal{K}+\mathcal{L}<em>{\mathrm{AM}}\left(s_t\right) .$ where $\mathcal{L}</em>{\mathrm{AM}}(s)$ is the Action Matching objective, which we minimize $\begin{aligned} \mathcal{L}<em>{\mathrm{AM}}(s) &amp; :=\mathbb{E}</em>{q_0(x)}\left[s_0(x)\right]-\mathbb{E}<em>{q_1(x)}\left[s_1(x)\right] <br> &amp; +\int_0^1 \mathbb{E}</em>{q_t(x)}\left[\frac{1}{2}\left|\nabla s_t(x)\right|^2+\frac{\partial s_t}{\partial t}(x)\right] d t \end{aligned}$ The term $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{AM}}$ is tractable</p> <h2 id="connection-with-optimal-transport">Connection with Optimal Transport</h2> <p>The optimal dynamics of AM along the curve is also optimal in the sense of optimal transport with the 2-Wasserstein cost. the optimal vector field in the AM objective defines a mapping between two infinitesimally close distributions $q_t$ and $q_{t+h}$, which is of the form $x \mapsto x+h \nabla s_t^*(x)$. This mapping is indeed the same as the Brenier map in optimal transport, which is of the form $x \mapsto x+h \nabla \varphi_t(x)$, where $\varphi_t$ is the (c-convex) Kantorovish potential</p> </body></html>
