PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, UC Riverside, advised by <a href="https://apparenthorizons.com/">Greg Ver Steeg</a>. 

I received my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2022, obtained my Bacherlor's degree in Automation in Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2019. 

My research interest includes inverse problems, (score-based) diffusion models; diffusion bridge models;  data-driven control; optimization and decision-making in power distribution networks; physics-informed neural networks and so on.

Our recent work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11893">"Measurement-aligned Flow for Inverse Problem
"</a> achieved the state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks, especially for inverse problems with unknown or non-Gaussian noise.

Our recent work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21553">"Stochasticity-controlled diffusion bridge"</a> achieves better sampling efficiency, image quality and diversity.

See my <a href="https://szhan311.github.io/cv/">CV</a> for details.
