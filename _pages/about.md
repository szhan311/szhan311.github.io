I am a 4th year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, UC Riverside, advised by <a href="https://apparenthorizons.com/">Greg Ver Steeg</a> from 2024. I received my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2022, obtained my Bacherlor's degree in Automation in Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2019. See my <a href="https://szhan311.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf">CV</a> for details. 


My research interest includes inverse problems, (score-based) diffusion models; diffusion bridge models, alignment and so on. 

Our recent work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07343">"Local MAP Sampling for Diffusion Models"</a> introduce a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods.

Our work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11893">"Measurement-aligned Flow for Inverse Problem
"</a> achieved the state-of-the-art performance on solving linear inverse problems, especially for inverse problems with unknown or non-Gaussian noise.

Our work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21553">"Exploring the Design Space of Diffusion Bridge Models"</a> achieves better sampling efficiency, image quality and diversity in many image translation tasks.
