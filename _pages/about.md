PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, UC Riverside, advised by <a href="https://apparenthorizons.com/">Greg Ver Steeg</a>. 

I received my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2022, obtained my Bacherlor's degree in Automation in Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2019. 

My research interest includes inverse problems, (score-based) diffusion models; diffusion bridge models, alignment and so on. 

Our recent work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07343">""</a> "Local MAP Sampling for Diffusion Models" introduce. a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods.

Our work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11893">"Measurement-aligned Flow for Inverse Problem
"</a> achieved the state-of-the-art performance on solving linear inverse problems, especially for inverse problems with unknown or non-Gaussian noise.

Our work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21553">"Exploring the Design Space of Diffusion Bridge Models"</a> achieves better sampling efficiency, image quality and diversity in many image translation tasks.
