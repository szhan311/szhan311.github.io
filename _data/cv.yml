    - title: Exploring the Design Space of Diffusion Bridge Models via Stochasticity Control
      institution: 
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Diffusion bridge models effectively facilitate image-to-image (I2I) translation by connecting two distributions. However, existing methods overlook the impact of noise in sampling SDEs, transition kernel, and the base distribution on sampling efficiency, image quality and diversity. To address this gap, we propose the Stochasticity-controlled Diffusion Bridge (SDB), a novel theoretical framework that extends the design space of diffusion bridges, and provides strategies to mitigate singularities during both training and sampling. By controlling stochasticity in the sampling SDEs, our sampler achieves speeds up to $5 \times$ faster than the baseline, while also producing lower FID scores. After training, SDB sets new benchmarks in image quality and sampling efficiency via managing stochasticity within the transition kernel. Furthermore, introducing stochasticity into the base distribution significantly improves image diversity, as quantified by a newly introduced metric.

      description:
        - "We provided a literature survey of recent data driven optimization and decision-making algorithms in power distribution networks. We summarized the related algorithms and divide those algorithms into four categories: mathematical optimization, learning-assisted optimization, physics-informed learning and end-to-end learning."

      institution:
      year: 2023
      description:
        - We propose a novel framework that employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to learn complex power system dynamics from noisy measurements. The numerical study results demonstrated the superior accuracy of the proposed model over the baseline neural network (NN) and its robustness against measurement noise. Furthermore, the analytics results verified the generalization performance across different fault durations and locations.

      year: 2022
      description: We proposed a Nearly-Hamiltonian neural network to predict transient trajectories and dynamic parameters of the power system by embedding energy conservation laws in the proposed neural network architecture. The numerical study results on the single machine infinite bus system show that the proposed model produces accurate system trajectories and damping coefficient predictions.
